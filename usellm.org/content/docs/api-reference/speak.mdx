title: llm.speak
description: Converts written text into spoken audio via Text-To-Speech
---

The `llm.speak()` method generates a spoken version of a given text, essentially a
Text-to-Speech (TTS) function. This function is useful for applications that
require vocalizing written text.

### Syntax

```typescript
const { audioUrl } = await llm.speak(options: SpeakOptions);
```

### Parameters

- `options: SpeakOptions`: An object that takes the following properties:

  - `text: string`: The text that needs to be converted to speech.

  - `model_id?: string` (optional): The ID of the model to be used for the TTS operation. Default is set to the latest model.

  - `voice_id?: string` (optional): The ID of the voice to be used for the TTS operation. Default is set to the latest voice.

  - `voice_settings?: { stability: number; similarity_boost: number }` (optional): Fine-tuning parameters for the voice.

### Returns

A Promise that resolves to an object:

- `{ audioUrl: string }`: A URL to the generated audio.

### Example

Here's an example of how to use `llm.speak()` in a React component ([live demo](https://usellm.org/demo/text-to-speech)):

```jsx
"use client";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";
import useLLM from "@/usellm";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function TextToSpeechDemoPage() {
  const [text, setText] = useState < string > "";
  const [audioUrl, setAudioUrl] = useState < string > "";
  const llm = useLLM({ serviceUrl: "/api/llm" });

  async function handleSpeakClick() {
    if (!text) return;
    const { audioUrl } = await llm.speak({ text });
    setAudioUrl(audioUrl);
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl w-full mx-auto my-4">
      <h1 className="font-medium text-4xl text-center">Text to Speech</h1>
      <Textarea
        className="mt-4"
        placeholder="Enter some text here"
        rows={5}
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <Button onClick={handleSpeakClick} className="my-4">
        Speak
      </Button>
      {audioUrl && <audio src={audioUrl} controls />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, the text entered by the user is converted to speech when the
"Speak" button is clicked. The spoken text can be listened to by the user as the
audio URL returned by `llm.speak()` method is used as the source for the `<audio>` HTML element.
